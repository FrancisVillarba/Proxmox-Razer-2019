# WORK IN PROGRESS

This is a work in progress documentation for our adventure (mis-adventures) into upgrading proxmox v8 to v9

## TODO

- Overview
- Rationale (Why did this need to happen)
- What did I do
  - What went well
  - What didn't go well
  - What did i learn
- Proper attribution for URLs / sources

## Notes to self

- Non-Enterprise Woes
- Duplicate Signing Keys
- System-boot package not required anymore
- pve8to9 --full script showing loads of errors
- Moving from list to source
- Needing to clean up apt source files
- Needing to move automount LVs to non-automount using helper script
